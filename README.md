# Redux

A secure link shortener PWA that allows users to create and manage links, with optional end-to-end encryption for enhanced privacy. 

## ToDo
- [ ] Implement logic to display the clear button only when the form contains input content.
- [ ] Enhance the displayUrlInfo function by adding a click handler to the "Visit URL" button, which will redirect users to the appropriate redirection page.
- [ ] Modify the behavior of the info button on the My Links page so that clicking it updates the URL in the address bar to /#id (where id is the identifier of the URL) instead of #info-page and ensure that when users click the "Back" button or navigate back, they are returned to the My Links page instead of the home page.
